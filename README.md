# practice-SQL-userManagementOps-Jill-S

In this practice, I worked with inserting new user data, updating existing records, deleting certain rows of data, and finally working with conditions, sorting, and setting query limits.  I understand all of these queries pretty well, and enjoyed experimenting with all of the ways to change and manipulate the data tables.  The most challenging thing for me at first was using the wrong execute button, and therefore I was duplicating my data table over and over.  Once I learned to use the other execute button, then I had to figure out how to go back and delete all of the unwanted duplicate data.  Once I did that, I had to figure out how to get my new user inputs to have ids that continued from where the original data left off, and did not continue at number 200 something where my duplicate data left off.  I got this all figured out, and now my table contains no duplicates, and has continuous ids as it should!
